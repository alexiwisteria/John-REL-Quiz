Much like life, each choice you made on this journey was an opportunity to grow closer to the light and align with God's will. As John teaches, 'God is light; in him, there is no darkness at all.' (1 John 1:5). In the forest, you faced moments of trust, service, and grace. These reflect the eternal call to follow Christ, share His love, and carry His light into the world. Let this journey remind you that every step, even those misdirected, can lead back to redemption when taken in faith."
